# Cross Platform Tactical Battle System Engine

**SRPG Engine MV** is a project that seeks to provide a fully open source implementation of the Simulator Role Playing Game (Tactical Battle System) based on underlying technology from [RPG Maker MV](http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/programs/rpg-maker-mv) (trademark by KADOKAWA, Inc.). The goal is to provide basic building blocks to game developers for creating their own Simulation RPG.

Our main principle is "**minimum change, emphasis on extensibility**". By making the best use of features that already provided in RPG Maker editor, we aim for a system that not only beginner friendly, but also expandable by javascript extension to ease game developer in adding more unique features for their games.
